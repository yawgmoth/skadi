# Project Direction

Our development work has shifted to more performant ways of getting at replay
data. Check out these projects instead if you're just getting started:

* [**clarity**](https://github.com/skadistats/clarity): comically fast Java parser
* [**smoke**](https://github.com/skadistats/smoke): fast python parser

Development on this project has been deprioritized in favor of these better
options.

You can view the original skadi readme [here](https://github.com/skadistats/skadi/blob/master/ORIGINAL_README.md).
